Getting and Cleaning Data Project

Repo for the submission for the project of getting and cleaning the data
In this project we collected and cleaned data from UCI to make it tidy data.  We unzipped the file. We then recorded activity training and test data of the suject and then we calculated certainmeasurement such as mean and Standard deviation.  Next we made the vairable more correct and calculated the average of certain paramters column variable. 
I designed
run_analysis.R that does the following. 
 1. Merges the training +  the test data  to make one data set.
 2. take the measurements of  the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 3.  name the activities in the data set  by using descriptive name
 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
 
 Code Book :
 
 Explains all the variable used
 
 

Finally I created the CodeBook.Rmd file that has more information
